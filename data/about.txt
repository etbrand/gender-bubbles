This Gapminder-inspired app was built to visually explore a core group of the <a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/gender/indicators">World Bank's set of gender indicators</a>. Indicators were selected based on coverage and interpretability. The dotted line represents parity - bigger gender gaps exist in countries further from the line. The compromise option for bubble size fudges population sizing to make sure small countries are still visible.<br / ><br / >Data were retrieved from the World Bank API on _DATE_. The most recent data available for each country were used. If the most recent year was different for male and female data in a country, the hover text will read (female year/male year) - for example, Sudan (2010/2008).
