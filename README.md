# Gender Bubbles

Repo for [this Shiny app](https://evanbrand.shinyapps.io/gender-bubbles/), which is a Gapminder-inspired vizualization of some of the World Bank's gender indicators.

The `get_wb_data.R` file retrieves the indicators from the World Bank API and prepares them for use in the app. The `app.R` file contains the code for the app itself.
